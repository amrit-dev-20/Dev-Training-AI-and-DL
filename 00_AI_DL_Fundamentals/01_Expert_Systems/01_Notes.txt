Expert Systems:
    - It is a set of rules which yield true/false values.
    - Based on the values obtained by training examples under these rules, the output is determined appropriately.
    - Similar to multiple if/else statements.
    - Examples: 
        a. used in organic chem. to find out structures based on rules.
        b. Misson Control for space programs
        c. Chatbots

Characteristics of Expert Systems:
    - High Performance
    - Understandable
    - Reliable
    - Highly Responsive.

Limitations of Expert Systems:
    - Too many rules to write down.
    - Certain rules are hard to define.
    - Some rules cannot be coded
    - Rules can be sometimes unknown.


Solution to above Limitations: Machine Learning
    -> It outsources the rule defining to the computer, by allowing it to find relationships between the input cond. & the output values.
    -> This allows the computer to use multiple iteratins, to redefine the initial rules.

Why ML is so successful?
    - Extremely large amount of data. 
    - Access from Multiple sources to use pre trained Models and Algorithms.
    - Relatively fast & cheap cloud/computing.

Roles involved in ML:
    - Collect & curate data. Define Tasks.
    - ML Engineering
    - ML Research
